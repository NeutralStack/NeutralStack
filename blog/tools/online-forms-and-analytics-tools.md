# Online Forms & Analytics Tools

In modern digital workflows, two capabilities often go hand‚Äëin‚Äëhand: **online form building** (to collect data) and **analytics/tracking** (to evaluate how that data is being collected, used, and converted). This article explores both sides ‚Äî what you should know when selecting tools, and a curated list of strong options.

## 1. Why Forms‚ÄØ+‚ÄØAnalytics Matter

### a) Forms: the data gateway  
Whether for lead capture, [surveys](https://blog.polling.com/the-role-of-survey-analytics-in-data-driven-decision-making/), registration, feedback, or conversion, online forms serve as the entry point for user interactions. A poorly designed form can create friction and reduce completion rates dramatically.

### b) Analytics: beyond ‚Äúwe got submissions‚Äù  
Simply knowing how many people submitted a form isn‚Äôt enough. Key questions include:  
- How many people *viewed* the form vs how many submitted?  
- At what field or step did users abandon the form?  
- Which traffic sources are driving form starts (and which lead to abandonment)?  
- How is form performance changing over time or across device types?

According to one guide, form‚Äëanalytics tools can track conversion rates, user behaviour, abandonment, time per field, ignored fields, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Another provider reports you can view metrics like unique views, conversion rate, and field bottlenecks. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### c) The synergy  
When your form tool *and* analytics layer are chosen well, you can optimise: reduce abandonment, improve user experience, increase quality of responses, and tie form performance to marketing/traffic‚Äëefforts.

## 2. Key Criteria for Choosing Tools

Here are some aspects to evaluate when selecting an online‚Äëform + analytics stack:

- **Ease of form‚Äëcreation**: drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop, conditional logic, mobile responsiveness.  
- **Submission tracking & metrics**: views, starts, completions, abandonment, time per field.  
- **Traffic/source attribution**: UTM tracking, integration with analytics platforms. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Behavioural analytics**: heatmaps, session recordings, field‚Äëby‚Äëfield bottlenecks. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Data‚Äëvisualisation and dashboards**: clear charts and reports that non‚Äëtechnical teams can use. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Integrations**: with CRM, email marketing, analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, BI tools).  
- **Scalability & privacy/ownership**: For bigger organisations, being able to host or own the data can matter (e.g., open‚Äësource options). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Cost & licensing model**: free tiers vs paid features, especially for analytics or advanced tracking.

## 3. Top Tools ‚Äì Form & Analytics Focus

Here are several standout tools in this space:

### ‚Ä¢ [Formstack](https://www.formstack.com/)  
A mature form‚Äëbuilding platform with built‚Äëin analytics for each form: you can view unique views, conversion rates, abandonment, and field bottlenecks. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
Great for organisations needing no‚Äëcode workflows + analytics insight.

### ‚Ä¢ [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/)  
Another strong form builder. Its ‚ÄúForm Analytics‚Äù page tracks responses and views over time. You can build visual reports (charts, tables) based on submission data. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
Good for teams wanting simplified analytics along with form creation.

### ‚Ä¢ [Lucky Orange (Form Analytics)](https://www.luckyorange.com/form-analytics)  
While less of a pure form builder, this focuses intensely on form‚Äëbehaviour analytics: time to start, time per field, abandonment by field, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
Ideal if your key interest is ‚Äúwhy are users not completing the form?‚Äù rather than just building the form.

### ‚Ä¢ [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)  
An open‚Äësource web analytics platform (formerly Piwik) offering full control, self‚Äëhosting options, heatmaps, session recordings, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
Best for organisations concerned about data‚Äëownership and privacy, or who need enterprise‚Äëlevel control.

### ‚Ä¢ [Looker Studio (formerly Google‚ÄØData‚ÄØStudio)](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting)  
While not a form‚Äëtool per se, it‚Äôs excellent for visualising form + analytics data from multiple sources. Connect your form/submission data + web analytics + other metrics. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
Useful for marketing/analytics teams wanting dashboards combining many data streams.

### ‚Ä¢ [Polling.com](Polling.com)  
Polling.com blends lightweight survey creation with built‚Äëin real-time analytics. Its design is optimized for high engagement in both internal feedback and public polls, with emphasis on quick deployment and shareability.  
Great for marketing teams or product researchers who want instant polling with analytics baked in.

## 4. Workflow Example / Best Practice

Here‚Äôs a suggested workflow to get the most out of forms + analytics:

1. **Build your form** using your chosen builder (Formstack, Jotform, etc.). Ensure it‚Äôs mobile‚Äëfriendly, has clear field labels, and uses conditional logic if needed.  
2. **Embed tracking**: add UTM parameters to traffic sources, link the form to your analytics platform.  
3. **Enable field‚Äëlevel analytics**: track views, starts, completions, abandonment per field.  
4. **Monitor regularly**:  
   - Which traffic sources produce high starts + low completions ‚Üí maybe quality issues.  
   - Which fields have high abandonment/time per field ‚Üí maybe confusing or too long.  
5. **Iterate & simplify**: remove or split overly long forms, reorder or clarify fields, add explanatory text.  
6. **Visualise & report**: create dashboards that show form performance over time, by traffic source, by device, etc.  
7. **Link to business outcomes**: submissions are great, but what matters is conversion to leads, sales, or whatever downstream metric you care about.

| Lucky Orange     | Deep form/field‚Äëanalytics focus                | Optimising form completion & UX issues       |
| Matomo           | Open‚Äësource analytics + full control           | Privacy‚Äëconscious orgs or enterprise needs   |
| Looker Studio    | Dashboarding across many data sources          | Marketing teams wanting full data‚Äëstack view |

## üéØ Final Thoughts  
If you‚Äôre just starting: pick a form builder with built‚Äëin analytics (e.g., Formstack or Jotform), get your form live, and track how users start and complete it. Then gradually add behaviour‚Äëanalytics (fields, abandonment) and dashboards.  
If you already have many forms and high volume traffic: you‚Äôll benefit from deeper analytics tools (Lucky Orange) or full stack/dashboards (Matomo + Looker Studio) so you can optimise conversion, reduce friction, and tie form performance back to business metrics.
