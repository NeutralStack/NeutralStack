# Why Cozy Games Are Booming

Cozy games have quietly taken the gaming world by storm. Characterized by relaxing gameplay, wholesome themes, and low-stress mechanics, these games offer a refreshing escape from the intensity of mainstream titles. As players seek more soothing, emotionally fulfilling experiences, cozy games are proving to be more than just a niche they're becoming a movement.

## üå± What Defines a Cozy Game?

Cozy games emphasize comfort, creativity, and connection. Some hallmark features include:

- **Gentle Pacing:** No timers, frantic combat, or punishing failure states.

- **Simple Mechanics:** Easy to learn, hard to "fail."
- **Aesthetic Design:** Soft visuals, ambient music, and charming animations.

Popular examples include *Stardew Valley*, *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*, and *Spiritfarer*. But more recently, this genre has expanded to include unexpected entries from the idle and clicker game communities.
